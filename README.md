# my_shopping_app
UWC Computer Science IA project
A program that let the students enter and make a list of the products which they want to order from Pune. The students will make a list via the user interface by adding /choosing the items they want to order. To create the list, I used the Database to make it easier to access all products in which the students are ordered. I created the code for the program with the Java programming language and MySQL for database management.

  - Login page with an email and password
  - Email varification of the new user
